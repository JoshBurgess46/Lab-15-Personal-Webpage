        Hello! I'm Josh Burgess and this is a little bit about me.
        I was born in Royal Oak, MI and lived in Inkster until I was 10 years old. I then moved to a small town in Monroe County, MI called Newport. There I spent my middle school and high schools years until I graduated in June 2014 from Monroe Jefferson High School. From ther I attended the University of Toledo with aspirations of being a Nurse Practioner.
