    <h2>Welcome to Josh Burgess's Webpage!</h2>
    <div>

        <p>
            My focus has been on becoming a Full Stack Developer to pursue my dreams of creating and managing webpages
            and software. I am accomplishing this my atteding Grand Circus which is a IT school located in the heart of
            downtown Detroit, MI.
            So far we have completed a plethora of labs and that I have exceeded expectation on and continue to improve
            my coding abilites and knowlege exstensively.
            Once I complete the Grand Circus Back-End C#.NET program I will be opeining up my own LLC for my freelancing
            company. Once that is running efficiently I will then return to Grand Circus and complete their Front-End
            Web Development course.
        </p>
        <p>
            I haven't accomplised much in my short 23 years on this rock but I am destined to do great things and make a
            difference in this world.
            My thirst for being successful in life and being a "somebody" has made me do the things I have done and put
            me in the blessed spot I am currently in.
        </p>
        <p>
            What being successful to me means not having to worry if the bills are paid or living paycheck to paycheck.
            Being successful to me means not having to worry about the "little things" and be comfortable enough to
            enjoy life and everything it has to offer.
            Success isn't determined by an individuals net worth or what title they hold, success is determined by how
            proud you feel about yourself and your accomplishments. In my eyes anyone can be rich and live a nice life
            but not everyone can be successful.
